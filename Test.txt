1.What is regression? What is retesting?
Regresion:We perform it to verify if a code change has not broke the funcion of the application.
Running again the tests in order to verify that previously software (program/ app) still work alright after change.
Re-testing: We finde a bug and we report it.We perform the re-testing after the developer fix the bug.
We finde and report a bug and after it is repaired we test it again to make sure that the application succesfully pass the test and the defect is fixed.


2.What is the relationship between the following: error, bug, defect, fault, failure.
An error is a mistake, misconception, or misunderstanding on the part of a software developer or the contact person between the client and developer.
A bug is the result of a coding. An Error found in the development environment before the product is delivered to the customer. 
Defect is an error found after the application goes into production. It is the deviation of the customer requirement.
A fault is introduced into the software as the result of an error.  It represents an incorrect step or process which causes the program to perform in unanticipated manner. 
A failure is the inability of a software system to perform its required functions (creadted following the requirements). Usually it is detected by the tester or the user.
 
3.Name the difference between agile & v-model. (Please specify some roles and cycles for these)
V-Model is very rigid compared with the Agile, Agile principles are: flexibility,adaptabillity and collaboration.
On V-model each phase must be completed before the next phase and V-shaped life cycle is a sequential path of execution processes,compared with Agile, where cycles are divided up into smaller modules.

On V-Model is any changes happend midway, then the test documents along with requirement document have to be undated, compare with Agile where if a change happend it dosen't affect to much the hole process.
On V-model the requirements are clearly defined and on Agile the solution involve throught the collaborative effort of self-organizatuon and criss-funcional teams and the customers.

V-model lifecycle: On the each phase, paralled activities can be done : code -> TEST CASES:unit test/low level design ->INTEGRATION TEST PLAN: system test/high level design ->SYSTEM TEST PLAN:integration test/functional specification ->ACCEPTANCE TEST PLAN:acceptance test /requirements specification.
Agile lifecycle:Iteration 1 :Requirements->Iteration2:Incremental->Iteration3 :Incremental ...

4.Please state what is black box testing? How about white box testing? You can also give an example.
Under Black box testing, we test the software from a user’s point of view, but in White box, we see and test the actual code.
Black box testing is realized without code access. The tester creates the rests useing the specification orother kind of model of what the system should do. It use case testing.
Example:The "sign in " page of a application.
White box testing is realized with code access. The starting point of testing is the code.
Example: An web application used to calculate the sum.

5.In the images folder you have a login form. Create Test Cases for the given form.

Please state the testing types(functional, non-functional, black box, white box, design technique) for each TC created.

Functional test : (White box)
1.Scenario:Verify Create account Function
Test case:Enter Valid Name, Valid E-mail and Valid Password
Pre-Condition Valid E-mail and Valid Password
Steps:Enter name,Enter E-mail, Entar Password, Click "Create Account Button"
Test data: Valid name, valid username, valid password
Expected result: Successful create account

Scenario:Verify Create account Function
Test case:Enter Invalid Name, Valid E-mail and Valid Password
Pre-Condition Invalid name, Valid E-mail and Valid Password
Steps:Enter name,Enter E-mail, Entar Password, Click "Create Account Button"
Test data: Invalid name, valid username, valid password
Expected result: The message" The name, e-mail and password you enteed don't match"

Analogue with invalid E-mail and Incalid Password.

2.Scenario:Verify Sign In Function
Test case:Enter Valid E-mail and Valid Password
Pre-Condition Valid E-mail and Valid Password , Account already created
Steps:Enter E-mail, Entar Password, Click "Sign In Button"
Test data:  valid username, valid password
Expected result: Successful sign in

Analogue with invalid E-mail and Incalid Password.

3. Scenario: Forget password 
Test case:Forgot your password
Pre-Condition Valid E-mail and Invalid Password , Account already created
Steps:Enter E-mail, Entar Password, Click "Forgot password"
Test data:  valid username, Invalid password
Expected result: Successful redirection to "Change Password Page"

Non-Functional test: (Gray Box)
Test1. The link should be accessed from all the browsers.
Test2: The filds  can be completed.
Test3. The letters from the password are covered with stars.

Design Test: (Black Box)
1.The logo is written correctly
2.The logo is positioned correctly
3.The words, sentances are written corectly.
4.The logo is visible.
5.The buttons are visible.
6.The page is designed following the customer requirements. 


6.Consider that you have found a defect in the form for the previous exercise. Create a bug report for it.

BUG ID
?	An identification number for the bug:01
?	Representative title for the bug: Duplicate account.
?	Reporter:Anca Damir
?	Data:4/24/2019

BUG OVERVIEW
?	Short description: When I insert the name,e-mail adress and the password on "Create Account" page,  I create an account . If I insert it one more time I create another account, duplicate. The web application allow me to create many accounts using the same e-mail and password without any error message or any direction to "Sign In" page.

BUG DETAILS
?	The steps to reproduce the bug: 
1. Access the link : https://github.com/alesanu/pentastagiu_modul1_test/blob/devel/images/diprella_login.gif
2. Type the name : Anca ,e-mail Ancastefaniadamir@gmail.com and the password Password123.
3. I create the account.
4. Go back to the "Create account" page and add the same name, e-mail adress and password.
